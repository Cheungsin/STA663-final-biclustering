# STA663 Final Project: Optimization and Demonstration of Biclustering using Sparse Singular Value Decomposition

author: Chengxin Yang, Guanqi Zeng

The project disects the paper Biclustering via Sparse Singular Value Decomposition and implement the SSVD algorithm in the original paper with optimized functions.

## Functions 

We created three main functions: the `SSVD`

## Package Installation
The package can be installed via the following command:

pip install git+https://github.com/GuanqizEng/STA663-final-biclustering.git@main
